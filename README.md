# 🚀 My AI Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my learning journey into AI tools and coding — starting from scratch and building toward creating websites and apps.

## 👋 About Me

I'm a beginner exploring the world of AI and coding. I'm learning by doing, documenting as I go, and sharing my progress openly.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning
